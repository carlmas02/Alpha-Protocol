# Alpha Protocol

## An Application made for a College technical fest .

Alpha protocol is an application which contains a storyline similar to a comic and once you read the storyline you get clues at the end of it.

### Once you find the clue there's an inbuilt scanner in the application which helps you scan the barcode hidden in different places.
### The application deducts 30 seconds for scanning the wrong barcode and there's a 30 minute time limit to finish the game.
### The player has to find out all the clues to win the game
